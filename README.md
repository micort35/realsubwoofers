# realsubwoofers 

A Twitter bot that tweets images of pinnipeds or swimming dogs (subwoofers!) daily!

## Design

Deployed via AWS Lambda, this bot uses the Twython API to interface with Twitter and tweet at a random follower with an uplifting message daily at 10:00 (UTC-4). The tweet consists of a random message selected from a list of wholesome compliments, as well as a random image or .gif from a curated library of subwoofers.

## TODO: 

* Enable request for a personal message from the bot, on a certain day
* Enable preference setting for dogs or pinnipeds via direct message
